# Muhammad-Ahsan

I am Muhammad Ahsan, a highly motivated individual with a strong educational background and a passion for leveraging technology to drive innovation. I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Engineering with a focus on Computer Science from Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan. Additionally, I have pursued specialized training in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning through prestigious programs like the Udacity AWS AI & ML Scholarship and the AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.

During my professional experience, I had the opportunity to intern at Goddard Discovery, a startup incubator where I worked on projects related to Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I conducted research and collaborated with teams to optimize R&D work, particularly in the area of Literature-Based Discovery. I took on the responsibility of researching and conceptualizing the development of Natural Language Processing for Literature-Based Discovery, working closely with the core Artificial Intelligence team. Additionally, I reached out to more than 10 local teams to explore opportunities for collaboration in insourcing and outsourcing of resources related to AI projects.

One of my notable projects involved developing a machine learning-based prototype to detect anti-Pakistan text in tweets. I collected around 2000 samples of tweets specific to Pakistan and performed Natural Language Processing techniques to clean, annotate, and vectorize the samples for feeding into the model. This project showcased my proficiency in NLP and my ability to utilize machine learning for language processing tasks.

In another project, I automated an Oracle database using OpenAI and Python. I leveraged the power of the GPT-3.5-Turbo OpenAI model, without fine-tuning, to design an optimized prompt for generating precise queries from natural language. This automation greatly improved query generation and retrieval of relevant results from the database.

Apart from my professional achievements, I have also excelled in hackathons and competitions. I was honored to be the Grand Prize Winner in the Xylem Innovation Challenge 2023. In this challenge, my team and I selected Track 3 in the university category, focusing on Data Science and GIS. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of plastic dumping in ocean dumpsites and developed a tailored solution based on our data-driven findings and available local resources. This experience showcased my expertise in data science and GIS applications.

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am committed to personal development. I have completed online courses in various domains, including prompt engineering for developers and LLM application development. Furthermore, I have honed my leadership skills through courses such as "Exercising Leadership: Foundational Principles" offered by HarvardX on edX.

Overall, I am a talented and ambitious individual with a strong foundation in computer engineering and expertise in AI and ML. My passion for innovation, dedication to learning, and accomplishments in diverse projects make me a valuable asset to any team or organization.
